# 🌍 The Leapfrog Model  
### *A Bottom-Up Framework for Practical AI Governance in SMEs*  

---

### 🧭 Overview  

**The Leapfrog Model** is a simple, scalable, and globally adaptable approach to **AI governance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)**.  
It reimagines compliance not as a legal burden, but as a gradual journey that any organization can begin — no matter its size, budget, or geography.  

The model’s strength lies in its simplicity: three clear tiers that help businesses build **trust, accountability, and fairness** into their AI systems step by step.

### ⚙️ The Three Tiers  

| **Tier** | **Principle** | **Action** |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **1. Disclose** | Transparency | Clearly inform users when they interact with AI systems. |
| **2. Document** | Accountability | Keep simple internal records of what the AI does, what data it uses, and its potential risks. |
| **3. Validate** | Fairness | Periodically check for accuracy, bias, and ensure human oversight where needed. |

Each tier represents a **stage of maturity**. Start small, build confidence, and evolve responsibly.

### 🌐 Why It Matters  

Most global AI governance frameworks are designed for large corporations, leaving 99% of businesses — SMEs — without accessible guidance.  
The Leapfrog Model bridges this gap by offering a **bottom-up, open-source standard** that anyone can adopt.  

It is lightweight, adaptable, and globally relevant — enabling responsible AI innovation from the ground up.
